    <h1>Building a Browser for Boston's Blue Bike Behavior</h1>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      Boston's Blue Bike network is incredibly expansive, with hundreds of
      stations and thousands of daily riders, a lot of valuable information can
      get lost in the vast amounts of data. However, one common problem for
      riders and bike maintainers alike is the issue of empty (and full)
      stations. If a station is full, it is not possible for a rider to return
      their bike to that station, and if a station is empty, it is not possible
      for a rider to take a bike. Visualizing trips across stations can help
      show which stations are available at which times thrwoughout the day,
      week, month, etc. In addition to understanding the popular stations and
      routes, this visualization can also help identify which areas of the city
      are underserved by the Blue Bike system.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>Data</h3>
      Our project visualizes data related to the Blue Bikes bike-sharing system
      in the Boston Metro Area. The data focuses on ridership patterns, bike
      availability, and route preferences to help optimize the system and
      improve its overall efficiency. The primary source of the data is the
      Boston Blue Bike official website, specifically the trip data from
      September 2022. The dataset includes information about trip duration,
      start and end times and stations, and anonymized user data. Biases and
      ethical issues embedded in the data are minimal, as the data is anonymized
      and does not contain personal information regarding the users who took the
      trips. However, there is a small possibility that someone could
      potentially track down a particular rider if they know a combination of
      information about the rider's exact start/end time or station. It is
      important to note that all of this data is anonymized, so any potentially
      identifying information is removed from the data set before it is
      published, making it tough to use for malicious reasons. Regarding data
      quality issues, the provided data from the Blue Bike system does not
      contain any missing values, and every row has complete information (except
      for the postal code column, which is irrelevant to the data
      visualization). Additionally, data is consistent across categorical
      attributes (e.g., Station Name) and requires no cleaning in this regard.
      The data was processed to better understand activity across different
      stations and dates. The original dataset was modified, and individual
      trips were removed. Instead, each station was given its own row, and the
      raw trip data was parsed to obtain the number of trips to and from each
      station for each day of the month. The region/neighborhood of each station
      was also added to the dataset. Furthermore, multiple new datasets were
      created containing a matrix with a row and a column for each station. The
      data in these new datasets represents the number of trips between two
      specific stations, where the row represents the start station and the
      column represents the end station. Link to data:
