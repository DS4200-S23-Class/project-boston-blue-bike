00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Boston Blue Bike Behavior Browser created by&nbsp;
Alexander Chang, Gavin Mooallem, and Shreya Mitra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.060
The visualization focuses on one month of data,&nbsp;
September of 2022, and displays a map of Boston&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.380
and a calendar on the right at the start.&nbsp;
Stations marked on the map are color coded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.820
to indicate the number of trips taken from that&nbsp;
station, with red stations having a higher number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.400
of trips. If we hover over the stations, we can&nbsp;
see the total number of trips from that station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.560
The calendar is color coded to show which&nbsp;
days had more trips, the deeper the orange,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.520
the more trips. Again, hovering over&nbsp;
will show us the number of trips.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.480
When we select a day or range of days, we can&nbsp;
see the map data change, because now itâ€™s only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.120
reflecting the data from those days. If we&nbsp;
were to now zoom in and select a station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.280
we can see the bar chart on the right, showing the&nbsp;
stations that trips ended at. As we can see here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.760
the most common destination for people starting&nbsp;
at MIT at Mass Ave / Amherst St is Beacon St at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.500
Massachusetts Ave. We can also change the&nbsp;
threshold for appearing on this bar chart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.000
allowing us to more easily visualize the data. As&nbsp;
we can see here it's kind of crowded, but if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.580
up the threshold, requiring a minimum of around&nbsp;
a hundred trips to be on this list, we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.200
that there's really only one, two, three, four,&nbsp;
five, six, seven stations that fit this criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.560
When a station is selected, hovering&nbsp;
over another station will show exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
how many trips were between them, and hover- and&nbsp;
highlight the corresponding bar on the bar chart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.140
as we can see here, the Deerfield St at&nbsp;
Commonwealth Ave had 126 trips from MIT/Mass Ave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.020
All of these tasks can be done with custom date&nbsp;
filters, so I have these three days, but I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.260
add a few more, or I could remove more, or&nbsp;
just have the full month of September data.
